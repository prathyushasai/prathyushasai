### Hi, I'm Prathyusha! 👋👩🏻‍💻

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Adobe, working on the Firegly / Gen AI Platform. 

I recieved my Masters in Information and Data Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and my Bachelors in Data Science and Cognitive Science from University of California, Berkeley (Go Bears! :bear: ). I am also heavily involved in organizations focused on empowering and encouraging minorities in STEM. 

In my free time, I enjoy teaching yoga 🧘🏻, traveling ✈️, and trying new food 🥘.
