### Hi, I'm Prathyusha! 👋👩🏻‍💻

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Adobe, engaging with core internal platforms to improve their reliability. Having worked previously with machine learning applications, I look for creative ways to integrate it into service reliability. 

I am currently working towards my Masters in Information and Data Science from University of California, Berkeley, with an emphasis in Machine Learning. I recieved my Bachelors in Data Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley (Go Bears! :bear: ). I am also heavily involved in organizations focused on empowering and encouraging minorities in STEM. 

In my free time, I enjoy teaching yoga 🧘🏻, traveling ✈️, and trying new food 🥘.
